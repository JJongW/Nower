# Design Skill Core

## Design Philosophy
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Toss Design System principles.
- Prioritize clarity, calmness, and spatial hierarchy.
- Avoid visual noise, excessive borders, and unnecessary decorations.
- Design should feel physical, grounded, and emotionally calm.

## Visual Hierarchy
- Use size, weight, spacing instead of color whenever possible.
- Primary action must dominate visual weight by at least 1.4x.
- Avoid more than 3 font sizes per screen.
- Avoid more than 2 accent colors per screen.

## Color Rules
- Base background: near-white or deep neutral.
- Accent color used only for:
  - Primary CTA
  - Active state
  - Important highlights
- Never use saturated colors for large background areas.

## Spacing System
- Use 4pt or 8pt grid consistently.
- Minimum touch target: 44pt.
- Vertical rhythm must remain consistent across screens.

## Component Discipline
- Prefer reusable components over local styling.
- Avoid inline magic numbers.
- All spacing, radius, font sizes should reference tokens.

## UX Behavior
- Reduce cognitive load.
- Default state should always be useful.
- Empty state must guide next action.
