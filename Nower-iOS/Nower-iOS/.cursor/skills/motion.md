# Motion & Interaction Skill

- Motion exists only to explain state change.
- Avoid decorative animation.
- Default animation duration: 180–260ms.
- Easing: easeOut for entrances, easeInOut for transitions.
- Never animate more than 2 properties simultaneously.
- Prefer opacity + transform over layout changes.
